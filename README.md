# TO-DO-LIST
This Python program is a simple command-line To-Do List Manager that allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks stored in a list. It uses a loop to continuously show a menu, takes user input for actions, and displays tasks with numbering for easy selection. The program ends when the user chooses the exit option.
